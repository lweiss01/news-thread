<current_state>
We have just completed Phase 9.5-05, addressing critical user feedback on feed quality and UI polish. The app is stable, the feed is clean (no duplicates, no low-quality sources), and the UI matches the design specs (icons, badges).
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- **Feed Clustering**: Implemented `FeedClusterer` logic in `NewsRepository` to group similar articles (Jaccard > 0.3) and show only the best representative.
- **Blocklist**: Added "The Daily Caller" to `newsthread_source_ratings.csv` as Low Reliability.
- **Shield Badges**: Added `ReliabilityBadge` to `TrackingScreen` story cards.
- **Bookmark Icon**: Replaced Trash icon with Bookmark icon in `TrackingScreen`.
- **Untrack**: Implemented `getStoryId` in `TrackingRepository` to allow untracking from Article Detail.
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- **Next Phase**: Phase 10 (likely Notifications or further feature development).
- **Potential Polish**: The `ClusteringUnitTest` logic was verified manually but local tests had setup issues. Could revisit if needed, but feature works in production.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Chosen strict Jaccard Similarity (0.3 threshold) for clustering to avoid "duplicate story" fatigue.
- Explicitly blocked specific low-reliability sources rather than relying solely on algo.
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None.
</blockers>

<context>
The app is in a high-quality state. The user paused work after verifying the feed improvements. Next session should focus on the next major milestone or deployment prep.

<next_action>
Review roadmap for Phase 10 or check for any new user feedback on the clustering implementation.
