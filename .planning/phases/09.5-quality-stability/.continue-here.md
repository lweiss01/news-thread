<current_state>
Implementation for Phase 9.5-05 (Feed Clustering, Badges, Untrack) has been written, BUT **VERIFICATION WAS NOT COMPLETED**.
The user reports the app is currently **buggy** and features are **not working as intended**.
The previous status update was incorrect; the app is NOT in a high-quality state.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- **Code Written**:
    - `FeedClusterer` logic in `NewsRepository`.
    - `newsthread_source_ratings.csv` update (Daily Caller).
    - `TrackingScreen` UI updates (Shields, Bookmark).
    - `TrackingRepository` `getStoryId`.
- **Pending**: ALL Verification and Debugging.
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- **CRITICAL**: Verify and Debug the "Feed Clustering" logic (User says it's not working).
- **CRITICAL**: Verify UI Badges and Icons.
- **CRITICAL**: Verify Untrack functionality.
- **Goal**: Actually stabilize the app before closing the phase.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Attempted to implement Jaccard clustering, but it needs debugging.
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- App quality is degraded. Need to pause and fix bugs upon resumption.
</blockers>

<context>
PAUSED mid-execution. The code changes were applied but the result is broken. Do not assume stability.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume debugging Phase 9.5-05 features. Run the app, reproduce the bugs, and fix the clustering/UI logic.
