{"id":"newsthread-1k5","title":"Investigate unexpected NewsAPI quota usage (145 requests)","description":"User reported 145 API requests on NewsAPI dashboard despite only opening the app ~10 times. Need to identify where extra requests are coming from.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. Wait for NewsAPI quota to reset (~18 hours from 2026-02-02)\n2. Clear app data on device\n3. Rebuild and run app\n4. Check Logcat filter 'NewsAPI-Request' to see all API calls\n5. Compare Logcat request count with NewsAPI dashboard\n\n## Added debugging\n- Detailed request logging in RateLimitInterceptor (commit c75d597)\n- Logs: request number, timestamp, endpoint, call stack, response code\n\n## Possible causes\n- Multiple ViewModel recreations triggering repeated API calls\n- Flow collection issues causing duplicate requests\n- Unknown background process\n\n## Updates\n- 2026-02-04: Did not notice any API limit behavior during Phase 2 validations. Leaving issue open to see if it happens again.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"lweiss01@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T17:29:34.3981238-05:00","created_by":"Lisa","updated_at":"2026-02-05T16:03:08.0049004-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-05T16:03:08.0049004-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed by Phase 1 caching infrastructure.
