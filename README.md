A native Android news reader that shows how different media sources cover the same story, plotted along a political bias spectrum. Built with an offline-first, privacy-first design, and all processing happens on your device.

## What Makes NewsThread Different ✨

### Bias-Aware News Reading ⚖️
- **Integrated bias ratings** on every article from three respected organizations
- Visual indicators showing Left (◄◄), Center-Left (◄), Center (●), Center-Right (►), Right (►►)
- Reliability ratings (1-5 stars) from trusted fact-checking organizations
- 50+ major news sources rated and categorized

### Perspective Comparison 🔍
Compare how sources across the political spectrum cover the same story. Inspired by Google News "Full Coverage" but with a bias transparency layer: articles are plotted along a continuous left-to-right spectrum so you can see where each source falls.

### On-Device NLP Matching 🧠
The matching engine uses TensorFlow Lite sentence embeddings running entirely on your device. No backend server, no data leaves your phone. The app extracts article text, generates semantic embeddings (384-dimensional vectors), and finds genuinely related stories — replacing keyword-based matching with real semantic understanding.

### Privacy-First Design 🛡️
- All processing happens on-device (no backend server)
- No tracking, no ads, no data selling
- Works offline with cached articles
- Future: data backed up to your own Google Drive

### Tooling & AI-Augmentation 🤖

NewsThread was built using a hybrid AI-augmented workflow, moving from foundational boilerplate to complex architectural engineering.

* **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)**: The primary forge for development.
* **[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)**: The agentic partner for complex phases (Orchestration, on-device NLP, and 16KB system fixes).
* **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)**: The foundational spark used for initial prototyping and Phase 1-2 UI/Repository boilerplate.
* **[GSD (Getting Shit Done)](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)**: The workflow framework providing structured research, planning, and execution cycles.
* **[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)**: Local system management and daemon integration.
 
### Matching Pipeline

```
Article Feed
  → Text Extraction (fetch URL + parse with Readability4J)
  → Embedding Generation (TF Lite sentence embeddings)
  → Hybrid Matching (cosine similarity + entity overlap)
  → Bias Clustering (join with source ratings)
  → Bias Spectrum UI (continuous left-to-right visualization)
```

## Source Bias Rating System 📊

> **Disclaimer**
>
> Bias ratings are provided for **informational and educational purposes only**. These ratings aggregate data from third-party organizations and represent general consensus, not absolute truth. Individual articles may vary from a source's overall rating. We encourage reading from multiple sources and thinking critically.

NewsThread uses a **consensus approach** combining three respected media bias organizations:

### Rating Sources
1. **AllSides**: Community-driven bias ratings
2. **Ad Fontes Media**: Interactive Media Bias Chart
3. **Media Bias/Fact Check**: Detailed factual reporting analysis

### Bias Scale
- **-2 (◄◄)**: Left — CNN, MSNBC, HuffPost
- **-1 (◄)**: Center-Left — NPR, Washington Post, Politico
- **0 (●)**: Center — Reuters, AP, BBC, The Hill
- **+1 (►)**: Center-Right — WSJ (news), The Economist
- **+2 (►►)**: Right — Fox News, Breitbart, Newsmax
- **?**: **Unrated Perspectives** — Sources not yet rated appear with a queston mark; they are still matched and clustered, but without a bias position.

### Reliability Scale (1-5 stars)
- **★★★★★**: Very High — Reuters, AP, BBC
- **★★★★☆**: High — NPR, WSJ, Washington Post
- **★★★☆☆**: Mostly Factual — CNN, Fox News
- **★★☆☆☆**: Mixed — Opinion sites, partisan sources
- **★☆☆☆☆**: Low — Conspiracy sites, misinformation

50+ sources rated including CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, Reuters, AP, BBC, NPR, New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, Politico, The Hill, Bloomberg, and more.
